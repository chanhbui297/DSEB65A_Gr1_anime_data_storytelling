## 🔄 5. Workflow (4-Phase Pipeline)

### **📋 PHASE 1 — Diagnostic EDA ("The Data Doctor")**

### **1. Overview**
**Notebook:** `01_Diagnostic_EDA.ipynb`  
**Goal**: The primary purpose of Phase 1 is to **diagnose all data quality issues** that may distort analysis or produce misleading insights. This phase establishes the foundation for a reliable preprocessing pipeline.

---

### **2. Key Discoveries from Diagnostic EDA**

- **Type Mismatches**: Critical numeric columns (Score, Episodes, Rank) stored as strings

- **Hidden Missingness**: 
   - Instead of NaN, Missing values are stored as 'Unknown', 'not available', 'n/a', 'na', 'tbd', 'tba' 
   - All columns has missing values. Especially, Licensors has the highest pperrcentage of missing with over 80%. 

- **Skewed Distributions**: Engagement metrics (Members, Favorites) with 99th percentile outliers
- **Inconsistent Formating**: 
   - Datetime format: '1-Sep-01', 'Oct 20, 1999 to ?'
   - Durations: '3 min', '3 min per ep'

- **Multi-label in Genre, Producers, Studios**: ['Action','Sci-fi'] make it impossible for running model

- **Ghost Records**: 1,330 entries with zero engagement metrics and no metadata

- **Data Integrity and Misclassification in Type, Ratings, Duration, Episodes**: 
   - Movie with `Episodes > 1`, or Movies with less than 40 minutes
   - Labeled with Adult genre but has an All-Ages Rating 
   - Episode with Durations > 1000 minutes

- **Date Paradoxes**: 7 records with end dates before start dates

---

### **3. Conclusion**
Phase 1 confirms that the raw dataset is **not suitable for immediate analysis**.  Thus, a robust cleaning and transformation pipeline is required to ensure Structural consistency and Logical validity.  

This diagnostic stage sets the foundation for Phase 2: **Data Preparation & Pipeline Construction**.

---

### **🛠 PHASE 2 — Data Preparation & Pipeline Construction**

### **1. Overview**
**Notebook:** `02_Data_Preprocessing.ipynb` and `Customtransformer.py` 

**Goal**: Build reproducible cleaning and transformation pipeline that handle issues stated in PHASE 1

**Outputs**:
- `data/processed/prepared_data.csv` (cleaned dataset)
- `models/processing_pipeline.pkl` (reusable pipeline)
- `models/model.pkl` (reusable Linear Regressor model)
- `src/Custom_Transformer.py` (custom class transformation used for pipeline)

---

### **2. Processing Steps**:

### **2.1. Pre-split cleaning (Structural Fixes Before Train/Test Split)**

### **A. Goal**  
Transform the raw file **`anime-dataset-2023.csv`** into a clean, structurally consistent dataset **`prepared_data.csv`**, ensuring:  
- Correct data types  
- Standardized formats  
- Unified representation for multi-label fields  
- Removal or correction of malformed entries

---

### **B. Critical Principle — Why these steps MUST happen *before* splitting**

These operations address **structural and domain-logic corrections**, not statistical learning.  
Applying them post-split would produce inconsistent schemas between train/test.

| Reason | Explanation |
|--------|-------------|
| **1. Maintain structural consistency** | Fixing types, list formats, and date formats must apply to all rows. |
| **2. No learned parameters** | These operations do **not** compute statistics (mean, median, quantiles). |
| **3. Domain rules apply universally** | e.g., cleaning genres, standardizing format, converting data type 'object' to 'numeric' and 'datetime' |
| **4. Required for sklearn pipelines** | Downstream transformers expect consistent input schema. |

---

### **C. Main Steps (Structural Cleaning)**

**Step 1.  Standardize "NaN-like" Values**  
- **Strategy**: Many object columns use string literals to represent missing data. We'll replace them with np.NaN
- **Example**: ['unknown', 'not available', 'n/a', 'na', 'tbd', 'tba', '---'] -> NaN

**Step 2. Handle Placeholder Zeros**  
- **Strategy**: The values `0` in `Rank` and `Popularity` don't represent a true zero value but rather a missing or unassigned one. These should be converted to `np.nan`.

**Step 3. Standardize Formating in (Aired, Duration)**  
- **Strategy**: 
   - Extracting `Aired Month`, `Aired Year`, `Aired Date Start`, `Aired Date End` from `Aired` column
   - Convert string Duration (`24 min`) into single numeric value (`24.0`) 

**Step 4: Handle multi-lable columns (Genres, Studios, Producers)**
- **Strategy**: 
   - Split string value into proper list ('MAPPA, White Fox' -> ["MAPPA", "White Fox"])
   - Fixing Typo and Inconsistency using mapping: "Sunrise Inc." -> "Sunrise"

**Step 5: Data Type Coercion & Logic Validation**
- **Type conversion**: Strings like "8.75" → float 8.75
- **Business rule fixes**: "Movie must have 1 episode" is domain knowledge, not learned from data
- **Ghost record removal**: Records with no score AND no metadata are fundamentally unusable

**Step 6: Drop Unnecessary Columns**

| **Feature Dropped** | **Reason for Dropping** |
|---------------------|--------------------------|
| **`Licensors`** | Missing over 80% of values → unreliable for analysis/modeling |
| **`Premiered`** | 77% missing + redundant (information extracted from `Aired` into `air_year`, `air_month`) |
| **`English name`** | Redundant (primary `Name` column sufficient for identification) |
| **`Other name`** | Redundant (primary `Name` column sufficient for identification) |
| **`Image URL`** | Non-feature data (image links cannot be used in current analytical scope) |
| **`Synopsis`** | Requires NLP techniques beyond project scope; would distract from core analysis |

### **2.2.  Splitting X, y and Train, Test set**

### **A. Spliting Target Variable - `Score`**

```bash
X = df1.drop('Score', axis=1)
y = df1['Score']
```

### **B. Spliting Train and Test set (80/20)`**
```bash

X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

```
The shape after splitting is:
   - X_train shape: (12553, 11), y_train ((12553, 1))
   - X_test shape: (3139, 11), y_test (3139, 1)  

---

### **2.3.  Post-Split Pipeline (Stateful Transformations)**

### **A. Goal**  
Produce final, fully processed Train/Test sets and store the fitted pipeline inside `models/` for use in  **PHASE 4 — Modeling Comparison**.

---

### **B. Critical Principal**: 
- These operations learn statistical parameters from training data only, preventing data leakage and support reproducing for future uses.
- Since our main goal is to find out which feature contributing to a successful Anime Released, post-released features like `Rank`, `Members`, `Popularity`,`Favorites` and `Scored by` will be removed to **prevent casual data leakage** when predicting `Score` of an Anime.

--- 

### **C. Custom Transformers (Using `BaseEstimator` and `TransformerMixin`)**

--- 

   **C.1. Class MultiListModeImputer**: 
   - **Purpose**: Imputing multi-label columns (Genres, Studios, Producers)
   - **Strategy**: 
      - Aggregate all items and find the mode (most frequent label) based on **Train set**
      - Any missing / empty list in Train and Test set is replaced with [most_frequent_label]

---

   **C.2. Class FrequencyGrouper**: 
   - **Purpose**:  
      - Reduce high-cardinality categories before appling One-Hot-Encoder on (Genres, Studios, Producers)
      - Result: From **1,287 features** after OHE -> **231 features**
   - **Strategy**: 
      - Compute frequency of each label in Train split only
      - Keep labels with frequency ≥ `min_freq[col]`
      - Replace all rare labels with "Other"

---

   **C.3. Class MultiLabelBinarizerDF** (Multi-Hot Encoding): 

   - **Purpose**:  
      - Transform list-like columns (Genres, Studios, Producers) into multi-hot encoded columns 

   - **Strategy**: 
      - Fit MultiLabelBinarizer per columns in Train
      - Transform/ Generate feature names: `ColumnName__Label` (example: `Genre_Action`)
      - Return concatenated DataFrame

--- 

   **C.4. CyclicalMonthEncoder**: 

   - **Purpose**: Convert months to sine/cosine features  
      - `Aired Month` are cyclical; month 12 is close to month 1, but ordinal encoding does not reflect this
      - Help model learn seasonality/ monthly patterns better

   - **Strategy**: 
      - Convert month numerics into sin/cos format: sin(2π * month / 12), cos(2π * month / 12)
      
--- 

   **C.5. FeatureEngineering**: 
   - **Purpose**:  
      - Add domain–relevant features that models cannot automatically create.

   - **Strategy**: 
      - Interaction terms:  `Episodes_x_Duration Minutes` help capturing combined effects on Score
      - Quantile-based categorization using `pd.cut()`: Created `DurationCat` and `EpisodesCat` features to capture non-linear relationships specific to anime formats and type (Movie is has only 1 episode and usually very long) 

      
--- 

### **D. Sklearn Library: Functions, Classes, and Rationale**
--- 

   **D.1.  Power Transformation - learns lambda parameter from Train only**: 
   - **Purpose**:  
      - Normalize highly skewed numeric columns
      - Suitable for Lineae Model

   - **Strategy**: 
      - Using Yeo-Johnson to handles zero (Counting_feature has 0 values)
      
--- 

   **D.2. SimpleImputer (median, mode) - learns values from Train only**: 
   - **Strategy**:  
      - Median → for numeric columns
      - Most Frequent (mode) → for categorical columns

   - **Reasons**: 
      - Robust to outliers, best choice when distributions are skewed

--- 

   **D.3. Scaling (RobustScaler) - learns quantiles from Train only**: 
   - **Strategy**:  
      - Uses median and IQR, not mean & std. 

   - **Reasons**: 
      - Dataset contains extreme outliers (e.g., 10,000+ episode counts for special cases) 
      - Resistant to heavy-tailed distributions

--- 

   **D.4. Encoding (OneHot, MultiHot) - learns categories from Train only**: 
   - **Strategy**:  
      - handle_unknown="ignore" prevents crash on unseen categories
      - Learns category vocabulary from train only

   - **Reasons**: 
      - **One-Hot Encoding**: Handle categorical features like Rating, DurationCat, EpisodesCat.
      - **Multi-Hot Encoding**: sklearn’s OHE cannot handle list-of-labels
       
--- 

   **D.5. ColumnTransformer**: 
   - **Strategy**:  
      - There are 4 sub-pipeline used for 4 groups of features 
      - 4 groups of features: Numeric, Ordinal Category, Multi-Lable Category, Cyclical features

   - **Reasons**: 
      - Apply different transformations to different feature groups.

--- 

### **E. Building Pipeline**
The `prepocessing_pipeline.pkl` has 2 sub-pipeline: `Feature Engineering Pipeline` and `Preprocessor Pipeline` as follows

```bash

### **📈 PHASE 3 — Comparative Analysis ("Before vs After")**

### **1. Overview**

**Notebook:** `03_Comparative_Analysis.ipynb`  

**Goal**: Visualize how clean data changes the narrative and support the keys to a successful anime

**Workflow**: This phase has 3 main Action

--- 

1. ACT 1 - THE SITUATION:
   - **Role**: Producer seeking the success formula for the next Anime project
   - **Goal**: Identify factors with strongest impact on Score
   - **The Conflict**: Raw data (df_raw) is chaotic, unusable for decision-making

---

2. ACT 2 - THE COMPLICATION & DISCOVERY
- Each Theme will have 4 main steps: Issues Overview -> Solutions -> Visual Evidence (Raw vs Cleaned) -> Deeper Visual Analysis for Business Recommendation
- The 4 main Theme Feature:  
      - Theme A: Target Variable (Score)
      - Theme B: Market Factors (Type, Source)
      - Theme C: Creative Factors (Genres, Producers, Studios)
      - Theme D: Release Strategy (Aired, Episodes, Duration)

---

3. ACT 3: THE RESOLUTION
      - Proof: Model performance comparison 
      - Strategic Recommendation for Producer
      - Takeaway: "Success is engineered through data-informed decisions"

---

### **2. Key Findings**

---

#### **Act 1: The Foundation: Target Variable Analysis (Score)**
   - **Issue Overview**: 37% missing scores, stored as text, distribution skewed by placeholder values

   - **Solution**: Remove missing, convert to numeric, validate logical consistency
   
   - **Visual Evidence**:
      - Raw: Bimodal distribution with artificial "0" peak
      - Clean: Normal distribution centered at 6.39, revealing true quality spectrum
   
   - **Conclusion**: 
      - *The actual `Score` distribution is bell-shape -> no need for transformation
      - *True high-scoring animes (Score >8.5) are rare, not artificially common*

---

#### **Act 2: The Complications & Discovery**

--- 

**A. Theme A: Market Factors (Type, Source)**
   - **Issue Overview**: Type misclassification (Movie with >1 episode), Source fragmentation (16 micro-categories), Unknown value

   - **Solution**: Reclassification logic, macro-categorization (5 groups)

   - **Visual Evidence**:
      - Raw: Misleading "OVA" dominance due to misclassified Movies
      - Clean: True distribution: OVA (6,062) > TV (5,511) > Special (3,673)

   - **Business Insight**: 
      - *TV series and Monvies have highest average Score (7.1)*
      - *Producers should prioritize source from **Manga or Literary properties** for maximizing Score*

---

**B. Theme B: Creative & Production Factors (Genres, Producers, Studios)**
   - **Issue Overview**: Multi-label fragmentation, high cardinality, inconsistent naming, Unknow value

   - **Solution**: Frequency grouping, name normalization

   - **Visual Evidence**:
      - Raw: "Sunrise Inc.", "Sunrise", "Sunrise Studios" treated as separate
      - Clean: Consolidated to single entity, revealing true market share

   - **Business Insight**: 
      - *Which Genres do top Studios consistently excel in, helping Producer decide on hiring Studio decision (example: White Fox Studio did best on Romance and Mystery)*

---

**C. Theme C: Release Strategy (Aired, Episodes, Duration)**
   - **Issue Overview**: Numeric, Datetime feature treated as text, fragmentation, high cardinality, inconsistent format, Unknow value

   - **Solution**: Convert to numeric, datetime type; Normalize format, Grouping into meaningful Episodes, Duration ranges and seasons

   - **Visual Evidence**:
      - Raw: Random monthly distribution, inconsistent format "3 min", "3 min per ep"
      - Clean: ordered monthly distribution, meaningful groups of episodes and duration ranges

   - **Business Insight**: 
      -  *12-13 episode format with over 60 minute runtime maximizes both Score and engagement*
      -  *Apr, Jul, Oct are the hot-month for releasing new anime*


--- 
### **⚖️ PHASE 4 — Modeling Comparison ("The Validator")**

### **1. Overview**
**Notebook:** `04_Modeling_Comparison.ipynb`  

**Goal**: Quantify the impact of data preparation via ML performance

**Methodology**:
1. **Baseline Model**: Linear Regression on minimally processed raw data
2. **Final Model**: Same algorithm on fully prepared data
3. **Comparison**: Metrics (R², MAE) and feature importance analysis

---

### **2. Metrics Results**:
| Metric | Baseline (Raw Data) | Final (Prepared Data) | Improvement |
|--------|-------------------|---------------------|-------------|
| **R² Score** | 0.09 | 0.53 | **+443%** |
| **MAE** | 0.64 | 0.48 | **-24%** |


---

### **3. Feature Importance Shift**:
- **Baseline**: Weak signals from Status, Rating, Source
- **Final**: Strong signals from Producers, Studios, Genres (properly encoded)
- **Insight**: Preparation unlocks the true predictive power of categorical features
